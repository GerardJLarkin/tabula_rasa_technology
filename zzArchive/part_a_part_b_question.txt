Thanks, given Part A, Part A1, and Part B. I want to implement Part A on a raspberry pi 5, and Part B on a separate raspberry PI. Can you provide an end to end script in C, that is the fastest implementation of the end to end script that will identify blobs of data that consists of groups of connected pixels where the video data feed is captured at 30 frames per second, the audio data feed is captured longitudinally over time between video frames, and attached to each group of pixels and sensor (gyroscope/accelerometer) data feed is sampled at the same rate as the video feed and attached to each group of pixels, then each blob (or all at the same time) are sent to the second raspberry pi where all of the blobs of data captured in the snapshot are then compared against 5000 existing blobs of data. Can you ensure to identify which parts of the script need to be run on the first raspberry pi and which parts need to be run on the second raspberry pi? Thanks
